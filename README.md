# Catalog project
This is a catalog application web example for my [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) **Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree**. This application is made using **Python** and you can check the modules you need to execute in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Run the application
* After you have installed all needed Python modules, open your Terminal Application, go to the application directory and type

    ``` terminal

    ```

### Application
* This application will give you the structure to interact with an events database.
* If you want to start with an empty database, you can delete the `events.db` file and the app will create a new one.
* If you use the provided database, there are two users you need `admin` and `manel`, both with the impossible to decrypt password `1234`
